--[[ Custom plugin config loader. ]]--

-- NOTE: in order to load your plugins, you must put 'require "myplugin"' for every lua file that you have.
-- eg. if you have a file called time.lua and a file called space.lua, you would put:
-- require "time"
-- require "space"
--
-- NOTE: In those files, you would load the settings of a plugin called 'time' and a plugin called 'space' respectively.
