# fclivaz' nvim config

you are free to use it, just make sure to tune it beforehand (eg. change your 42header or delete the lua files of plugins you don't want to use.)

in order to install:

```shell
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
git clone https://github.com/fclivaz42/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
```
or 
```shell
git clone git@github.com:fclivaz42/nvim-config.git /home/fclivaz/.config/nvim
```
if you are me :)

enjoy!
